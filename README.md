## Data Processing

### Download Movement Speed Data

1. Open the download page of [Uber movement project](https://movement.uber.com/). Take an example like New York, please try [https://movement.uber.com/explore/new_york/speeds](https://movement.uber.com/explore/new_york/speeds).
2. Set the product as `speeds` and one specific time period.
3. Download data and save it on your computer.

### Extract Roads/Streets

Please download `movement-speeds-hourly-new-york-2019-1.csv` (movement speed data file of New York City in January 2019).

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

data = pd.read_csv('movement-speeds-hourly-new-york-2019-1.csv')
road = data.drop_duplicates(['osm_way_id', 'osm_start_node_id', 'osm_end_node_id'])
road = road.drop(['year', 'month', 'day', 'hour', 'utc_timestamp', 'segment_id', 'start_junction_id', 
                  'end_junction_id', 'speed_mph_mean', 'speed_mph_stddev'], axis = 1)
road.to_csv('road.csv')
```

In New York City, there are 98,210 roads/streets.

### Construct Speed Matrix

This process is time-consuming.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

month = 1
data = pd.read_csv('movement-speeds-hourly-new-york-2019-{}.csv'.format(month))
road = pd.read_csv('road.csv')
tensor = np.zeros((road.shape[0], max(data.day.values), 24))
k = 0
for i in range(road.shape[0]):
    temp = data[(data['osm_way_id'] == road.osm_way_id.iloc[i]) 
                & (data['osm_start_node_id'] == road.osm_start_node_id.iloc[i]) 
                & (data['osm_end_node_id'] == road.osm_end_node_id.iloc[i])]
    for j in range(temp.shape[0]):
        tensor[k, temp.day.iloc[j] - 1, temp.hour.iloc[j]] = temp.speed_mph_mean.iloc[j]
    k += 1
    if (k % 1000) == 0:
        print(k)
mat = tensor.reshape([road.shape[0], max(data.day.values) * 24])
np.save('hourly_speed_mat_2019_{}.npy'.format(month), mat)

del data, tensor
```

The matrix's row corresponds to one specific road/street, while the column corresponds to one specific hour.
